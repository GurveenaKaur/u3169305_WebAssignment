Design:
The development of the design was changed throughout the pages of my website, as of being a very teenage group focused. 
The colour scheme of my website design is kept subtle with a bright pop of the yellow titles throughout. Font style is kept 
as the default for description of the paragraphs. The colour of the font is also kept black for most of the text. I have added
a background image with the title page on each one the six html pages.
The inspiration of the logo came from the title of the website. “Churchill House” and as well as my first name initial “G”. I
created this using paint creating two circles with a border on the second. The initial inside the circle illustrates the 
letter C, imagery of the hill and as well as a G.
I have designed each page of the web application according to the wireframes with logo, colors, animations based on what 
project needed.
Reason why I rearranged my designs for some webpages is because, they visualize a lot neater and sharp as per my original 
design.
Development:
Backend Development:
I started off with creating a basic structure for all my html files by
referring back to my wireframes and making few changes to some html files as my preference. They are slightly modified 
compared to the wireframes. I have placed the logo just below the headings of each page now, as this looks a lot neater.

The history.html page is designed very simple for the viewers to easily navigate their way around the images and the history. 
The images are viewable in a new tab by clicking on them.
Frontend Development:
The main website visualizes a modern atmosphere to the audience. As this was one of the requirements, it has appeared to 
polish very well. Especially with the logo design that blends in with the website.
Development Process:
The process of creating the logo was fairy straight forward. Paint application was used to create this, by creating round 
circles with the imagery of letters C, H and G.
Images were to be used from the asset folder from the canvas site, this was an essential stage of the web development as 
the backgrounds had to match my colour scheme to a subtle artistic imagery. This was performed well as I was provided with 
images of the architect buildings and blended well for my background images.
The six webpages were designed with a similar design concept with background transitions.
Challenges/Solutions:
o The most challenging part of designing this website was creating the Image grid on history.html as I had chosen an img tag 
for logo as well as my images. This caused a clash of my images on the history page grid to appear smaller. This was solved by removing the css for img logo and keeping the main size I wanted for my images on history page.
o File format was another challenge I faced, as I have already made sub folders for css, html, img and logo. As of per 
requirement I was not able to rearrange the folders in time. But, I managed to create a separate file location and shift 
all the data across.
